The confirmation screen will ask what your plans are. The answers you give will change which shortcuts are added to the menus when you log in.

## Set up the call routing

You need to find the TwiML Bin product. Start by clicking on "Explore Products".
![setup call routing](./screenshot-30.png)

Find "TwiML Bins". Clicking the "Pin to sidebar" button will make it easier to get back to this again later.
![setup call routing](./screenshot-31.png)

From the TwiML Bins screen, click the "Create new TwiML Bin" button.
![setup call routing](./screenshot-32.png)

The TwiML Bin screen gives you a place to give your function a name, and a window for describing the function in XML.
![setup call routing](./screenshot-33.png)

Here is a suggested configuration:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Response>
  <Start>
    <Stream url="wss://REPLACE-THIS-HOSTNAME/ws/caller" track="inbound_track"/>
  </Start>
  <Start>
    <Stream url="wss://REPLACE-THIS-HOSTNAME/ws/receiver" track="outbound_track"/>
  </Start>
  <Dial>
    REPLACE-THIS-NUMBER
  </Dial>
  <Pause length="40" />
</Response>
```

Replace `REPLACE-THIS-HOSTNAME` with the URL for where you are running the application.

Replace `REPLACE-THIS-NUMBER` with the phone number that you want to direct phone calls to.
